Help me find ingredient substitutes for [{user_dish}]. Iâ€™m preparing this dish but have run into a few missing items in my kitchen. I have a variety of basic ingredients like flour, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, and some vegetables, but Iâ€™m missing a few key components. Iâ€™d prefer not to shop for new ingredients, so please suggest substitutes using what I already have. Additionally, Iâ€™d like tips on adjusting the recipe to maintain flavor and texture with these substitutions. If possible, offer a creative twist to enhance the dish with my available ingredients. Iâ€™m also curious about a quick side dish that pairs well with [{user_dish}] and can be made in under 15 minutes. What do you recommend?
