## üåê Introduction

**Dishcraft** is a full-stack, three-layer web application designed to deliver a seamless and intelligent user experience through a modern tech stack. Built with a React-based frontend, a robust Spring Boot API server, and a Python-powered LLM API endpoint, Dishcraft leverages a MySQL relational database to manage structured data efficiently.

The system architecture separates concerns into three distinct layers:

- **Frontend (React)**: A responsive and interactive user interface that communicates with backend services via REST APIs.
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**: A scalable and secure API server that handles business logic, authentication, and database operations.
- **AI Layer (Python LLM)**: A dedicated service that provides natural language processing capabilities, offering intelligent features powered by large language models.

Dishcraft is designed with modularity, scalability, and maintainability in mind, making it ideal for teams looking to integrate AI-enhanced features into a traditional web application framework.


## üéØ Purpose

**Dishcraft** is an AI-powered recipe platform designed to enhance the cooking experience by offering intelligent ingredient suggestions and detailed, personalized cooking instructions.

The goal of this project is to:

- Provide users with alternative ingredient suggestions based on what they have at home or dietary preferences.
- Generate step-by-step cooking instructions using AI, based on minimal recipe data stored in the database.
- Offer a lightweight, scalable solution for managing and enhancing recipe content using large language models (LLMs).

The backend database stores essential recipe data, including:

- Cooking time  
- Short description  
- Required ingredients  
- Concise cooking instructions  

From this minimal data, Dishcraft leverages AI to deliver a richer, more interactive and adaptive cooking assistant experience.
